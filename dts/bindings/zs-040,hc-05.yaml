   This is a device driver for the zs-040 hc-05 serial bluetooth modules

# Used to match nodes to this binding as discussed above:
compatible: "zs-040,hc-05"

properties:

  uart:
    type: phandle
    required: true
    description: GPIO pin configurations. We expect
        that the phandles will reference pinctrl nodes.
